Annotator
=========
The Annotator is a Google Chrome Extension used to add notes and highlight text directly on a webpage.
The extension has three features:
1. Highlight: it allows the user to select any block of text on any webpage and then highlight it in the chosen color.
2. Add note: directly add a note to a webpage.  The note can be collapsed so as not to clog the page.
3. Save: save the notes and highlights to a PDF file

The highlight feature has a "transparent" color used to "unhighlight" any previously highlighted text.

Using Chrome's native features, the "Save" feature can be used to send the PDF directly to a printer, to export it to 
the user's Google Drive, or to save the PDF locally.

Hover your mouse over the different features to reveal the tooltip.

How to install: 
Download the source code.
Chrome > Settings > Extensions > Enable Developer Mode > Load unpacked extension > Select the source folder

The Annotator is a project course work.  
The course was The Design of Interactive Computational Media at the University of Toronto.
The extension was implemented by a team of 5 people.
I was responsible for implementing the "Add Note" functionality of the extension (note.js).  I am not responsible for my teammates code. Please see references in the code.

The Annotator is functional but still a prototype.
The extension was implemented using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
